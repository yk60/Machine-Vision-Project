## Machine Vision Project
### Objective
-  Establish a grounding in the requisite areas of Linear Algebra and the NumPy library to distinguish hand-written digits in the MNIST dataset.
- Apply those techniques to a Machine Vision problem to differentiate real-world objects, such as dogs and cats.

### Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, PIL library
- html, css

### Test instructions
```
python main.py dataSet=MNIST classes="0,1" imgSize=28,28

python main.py dataSet=ImageNet classes="00153,00284" imgSize=28,28
```
#### Run the unit tests
```
python test.py
